# BuzzBots: A Modular Toolkit for Mechanical Creatures

**BuzzBots** is an open-source system for building simple, vibration-actuated robots. By combining 3D-printed parts with standard M3 hardware and a single vibration motor, you can create anything from a physics-testing "bristlebot" to an autonomous drawing machine.

## History

I developed this toolkit back around 2012-2014. You can read about it on my website:

Here's an early prototype made with a popsicle stick.

Then you can see it progress...

... to the final form.

## 🛠 What You’ll Need

I’ve designed these to be built with common "ingredients" to maximize the chance that they can propagate and grow in the wild:

1. **3D Printed Parts:** (Found in the `/print ready parts` folder)
2. **Hardware:** Metric 3mm (M3) bolts and nuts, stiff steel wire
3. **Power:** A single AAA battery and a small vibration motor.
4. **Tools:** A 3D printer, drivers for your bolts, hot glue gun

## 🚀 Get Started

1. **Download:** Clone this repo or grab the STLs from the `print ready parts` folder.
2. **Print:** Use standard FDM settings (PLA works great).
3. **Fabricate** Make legs out of stiff wire and put a drop of hot glue on the end to make a foot.
4. **Assemble:** Use the modular holes to bolt together your own morphology.
5. **Share:** If you make a drawing bot or a new "species," share it online and with your friends.

## History

This project began around 2012 with a simple popsicle stick prototype. It has since evolved into the modular system you see here. You can read more about the philosophy and see videos of the bots in action [on my website](https://andrewfrueh.com/buzzbots/).
