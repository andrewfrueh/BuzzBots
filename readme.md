# BuzzBots: Unleash Your Creativity with Tiny, Buzzing Robots

Bring your imagination to life with BuzzBots, a modular vibration-actuated toolkit that lets you build anything from walking creatures to rumbling machines!

## History

I developed this toolkit back around 2012-2014. You can read about it on my website:

Here's an early prototype made with a popsicle stick.
